            <h2>History of the caribou logo</h2>
            <p>In 1907, Wilfred Grenfell, a medical missionary to Newfoundland from London, imported 300 Norwegian reindeer. The reindeer 
            were intended to be used as food and draft animals. Some of the reindeer were sick with a parasitic roundworm that infected
            the local caribou. All of the imported reindeer eventually perished but the strain of roundworm affects the native caribou
            species to this day. The caribou logo serves as a reminder of the far reaching effects of our decisions.
